# Black_Scholes_Call_Option_Pricing_Model
A Black Scholes call equity option pricing model I coded in q.
Note the data file must be only daily stock price on each line of the file and nothing more.
I have also included an example of the stock price and option price for Hargreaves Lansdown stock with a period of 90 days, a constant risk free interest rate of 2% and a strike price of Â£13.
The maturity is assumed to be the day after the end of the data provided.
The code will output a csv file with all the quantities calculated including the call option price for each data point.
To run the code from a command line in a q environment execute the following commands:
\l option_pricing.q
f `filename ; time period for variance ; risk free interest rate ; strike price
